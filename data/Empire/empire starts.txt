	log "Factions" "Empire Navy" "The Empire Navy, usually called The Empire or Cromha Empire is a military organization that rules all systems that The Cromha Empire controls. They defend the Empire's systems in the core against the Syndicates and Pirates, and they also defend against Empire Rebels, who often intercept Mineria colony transports. They are one of the most advanced military organizations with their great ships and high-tech outfits that let them dominate other major organizations in terms of combat power. They created an Alliance in the year of 2973 with the Hai, Wanderers, Quarg, and Remnant."
		log "Factions" "Mineria Colonies" "The Mineria Colonies are in some way part of The Empire Navy. They are principally a product exportation company. They sell Mineria materials in the whole of Empire Space for cheap prizes and also sell them to some allies of the Empire Navy. The Mineria Colonies are one of the richest organizations in the whole galaxy; they produced more than 4.894T credits in the year of 3018. Contrary to the Merchants, their ships have great defenses and great cargo capacity. You can find them everywhere in Empire Space."
		log "Factions" "The Great Alliance" "The Great Alliance is a union between The Empire, the Wanderers, the Remnant, the Quarg, and the Hai. This pact was made to protect communication and commercial products in northern space and in the Ember Waste to ensure deliveries of primal materials to the Remnant who are isolated in the galaxy. It was also made to protect the Quarg from the Heliarch and the Coalition. The Empire use it to protect themselves from the Korath such as the Kor Sestor, Kor Mereti and Kor Efreti, hostile Korath species that attack them often in Empire Space."
		log "Factions" "Empire Merchants" "The Empire Merchant is a global organization like the Mineria Colonies, an organization that gives rights for trading and space traveling to people who are part of it. The difference with the Mineria Colonies is that they are not a government, and they don't own any system, planet or station. This organization allows anyone to start their journey in Empire Space as a free Merchant rather than an Empire worker, employee or anything of the sort."

	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 3,000,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of a year. Your daily interest rate is 0.00000000008%. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`

	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel, wonderful smells. There are many ship models to choose from, but only some are within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`
