	description "At first, when the Lifdot Industries released the Phasic Radiothermal near the beginning of the Empire, it was a huge success in Empire Space. But only a decade ago, everyone stopped using it. Instead of removing the Phasic Radiothermal from Lifdot outfitters, they decided to lower the price by 45%. This outfit is not installed by default on any Lifdot Industries ships, but you can often find Empire Merchants using this power source."
	description "The only big downside to this reactor is the fact that it produces a lot of heat and only 60% of the heat is cooled by an integrated system."

	description "Originally, a Dwarf Core was a miniaturized nuclear reactor, small enough to be installed in any ship larger than a fighter. It was designed by Deep Sky to be paired with their power-hungry atomic engines."
	description "Then, Lifdot Industries scientists modified it to use antimatter. This allows it to produce large amounts of energy along with a negligible amount of heat. They also added an integrated cooling system and an energy capacitor. You won't see in any Lifdot ships, but almost every Empire Merchant ship larger than a fighter has this outfit installed."

	description "At first, fission reactors in human space were the best source of energy. But, Lifdot Industries found the reactor to be useless, and the product of their modifications became their first successful outfit."
	description "Although this technology is outdated now, there is still a small amount of Empire Merchant captains who use these engines, so Lifdot Industries still produce them. Its main problems are the mass, outfit space, and heat generation, but it is able to cool 45% of its heat through an integrated cooling system. But, it is still better than any human reactor."

	description "Fission reactors are considered a rudimentary technology among interstellar species. Nonetheless, it remains a proven and safe technology that even the Hai use fairly regularly."
	description "It is the 'auto-efficient' part of the Multiphasic Reactor that makes it powerful: It has cooling ducts integrated into its systems, which prevents it from producing almost any heat. It is small and can be installed in almost all ships. This reactor is used for almost all Empire fleet ships."

	description "The Quantum Generator was designed for ships with needs similar to the heaviest Lifdot ships. This includes ships like the Empire Fortress, Empire Kraken, and other world-ships. This generator uses antimatter like the Quarg. It has incredible energy/heat and energy/weight ratio, and it has integrated cooling which allows it to produce almost no heat: 87.5% of the heat is addressed through the cooling system."
